# Contriboot Rails

This is a contribution tool built specifically for the Ruby Unconf Hamburg 2018. It is heavily inspired by the [JSUnconf.eu Contriboot](https://github.com/jsunconf/2017.contriboot) but written from scratch in Ruby on Rails, as it should be :)

It was generated using a [Rails App Composer](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer) template for GitHub authentication and also for styling via Bootstrap/Sass.

If you find any problems, please [create an issue](https://github.com/rughh/contriboot-rails/issues) or send a pull request.

## Hosting

Hosting is sponsored by [Depfu](https://depfu.com) and the app runs on a hobby dyno on Heroku.

If you need deployment permissions, please contact @halfbyte on Slack.
